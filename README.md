# Advanced_data_storage_and_retrieval

* A fun practice to do a climate analysis querying weather database with `sqlalchemy` ORM, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
  * For `SQL` practice purpose, just implemented raw sql query + `pandas read_sql_query()` combination for almost every analysis.
* Also created an web app based on `Flask` to get the results of the developed queries.
  * Implemented `Flask.render_template()`, <strong>NOT</strong> `Flask.jasonify()`, for making an advanced, more interactive web app environment.
